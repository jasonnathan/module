rocket:module
=============

ES6 Modules for Meteor. (And CJS/AMD too!)

**NOTE: This isn't ready yet! It'll be ready at v1.0.0. It's in a usable state
if you'd like to provide early feedback, but note that the [usage
instructions](https://github.com/meteor-rocket/module-example-app) might change
a little before 1.0.0. :)**

Installation
------------

```sh
meteor add rocket:module
```

Roadmap/tasks until first release
---------------------------------

These steps are mostly in the order that they'll be developed. Semver rules
apply starting from v0.2.0.

### v0.2.0 (first usable version)
- [x] Register a new compiler with Plugin.registerCompiler.
- [x] Redo everything but with the files handed to rocket:module by Meteor,
      thus eliminating the two previous month's worth of work. (:

### v1.0.0
- [x] Switch to npm CLI instead of programmatic usage to see if that fixes
      random NPM bugs that don't happen when I try from CLI.
- [x] Ensure that files that aren't handled by Webpack (for applications) are
      given back to Meteor so they can be executed.
- [ ] Add sub-node_modules folders to the resolve/resolveLoader root option if
      there are any (it happens with dependency forks, but most of the time the
      first level node_modules folder will be flat).
- [ ] Use Webpack's caching feature so that only modified files are rebuilt.
      Make sure to write the replacement of `window` by `RocketModule` to the built
      files if Webpack's cache reads the built files.
- [ ] Add common Webpack loaders: babel, coffeescript, typescript, jsx, glslify,
      css, less, sass, and stylus.
- [ ] Get code splitting working (webpack/webpack issue #1296). Currently each
      entry point is having duplicate code, which is the same as Meteor's
      dependency handling.
- [ ] Handle source maps.
- [ ] Use `npm outdated` to detect if we need to run `npm update`. We'll need
      to run the update command when dependencies listed in npm.json files have
      changed in order to update the local packages.
- [ ] Test in Windows.
- [ ] Report file-specific Webpack errors using corresponding InputFile.error() calls.
- [ ] Finish commented TODOs that are left in rocket:module.
- [ ] Update README with usage and configuration documentation.
  - [ ] Describe how to use npm dependencies in an app directly, using a spare
        local package (basically like what meteorhacks:npm does).
- [ ] Celebrate! Wooooo!
