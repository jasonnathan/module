rocket:module
=============

ES6 Modules for Meteor. (And CJS/AMD too!)

**NOTE: This isn't ready yet! It'll be ready at v1.0.0.**

Installation
------------

```sh
meteor add rocket:module
```

Roadmap/tasks until first release
---------------------------------

These steps are mostly in the order that they'll be developed. *Semver rules won't
apply until version 1.0.0.*

### v0.2.0 (first usable version)
- [x] Register a new compiler with Plugin.registerCompiler.
- [x] Redo everything but with the files handed to rocket:module by Meteor,
      thus eliminating the two previous month's worth of work. (:

### v1.0.0
- [ ] Add common Webpack loaders: babel, css, coffeescript, typescript, etc.
- [ ] Use Webpack's caching feature so that only
      modified files are rebuilt. Make sure to write the
      replacement of `window` by `RocketModule` to the built
      files if Webpack's cache reads the built files.
- [ ] Get code splitting working (webpack/webpack issue #1296). Currently each
      entry point is having duplicate code, which is the same as Meteor's
      dependency handling.
- [ ] Handle source maps.
- [ ] Test in Windows.
- [ ] Output errors encountered by Webpack when compiling entry points, using
      InputFile.error()
- [ ] Finish commented TODOs that are left in rocket:module.
- [ ] Update README with usage and configuration documentation.
  - [ ] Describe how to use npm dependencies in an app directly, using a spare
        local package (basically like what meteorhacks:npm does).
- [ ] Celebrate! Wooooo!

### v1.x.x (in order of importance)
- [ ] Support npm dependencies for apps that already use meteorhacks:npm.
  - [ ] Detect meteorhacks:npm's local "npm-container" package and install it's
        npm dependencies alongside those of the packages dependent rocket:module.
- [x] Code split for each architecture instead of all at once (each
      architecture may possibly have different shared modules).
