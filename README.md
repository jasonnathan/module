rocket:module
=============

ES6 Modules for Meteor. (And CJS/AMD too!)

**NOTE: This isn't ready yet! It'll be ready at v1.0.0.**

Installation
------------

```sh
meteor add rocket:module
```

Roadmap/tasks until first release
---------------------------------

These steps are mostly in the order that they'll be developed. *Semver rules won't
apply until version 1.0.0.*

### v0.1.0
- [x] Move webpack into a separate Meteor package since it is a binary package,
      then rocket:module doesn't need to be built for every architecture every
      time it is updated.

### v0.1.1
- [x] Move the css, style, and babel loaders into rocket:webpack too. This will
      allow it to binary build along with Webpack. It's lame that we need to do
      this.
- [x] Make rocket:module find the `npm/node_modules` folder of the
      rocket:webpack isopack and add that to Webpack's config so that loaders can
      be found by Webpack.

### v0.1.2
- [x] ~~Override semver methods so they work with Meteor versions~~, or use Meteor's
      package-version-parser package that has some similar functions.

### ~~v0.1.6~~

> Plugin.registerCompiler has arrived in the devel branch of Meteor, so work for
> this version, 0.1.6, will be halted, and rocket:module refactored/rewritten for
> the new and much better API.

- [x] ~~Make rocket:module's source handler simply prepend a comment that the
      file is in need of compiling.~~

- [x] ~~Detect if the build plugin provider script is running for the first time
      at the initial execution of the meteor command, or if it's running due to a file
      change.~~

- [x] ~~On first run of `meteor`, detect and count how many files need to be
      compiled on the app side for local packages and the app itself, then add a
      hook that allows a function to run once local files have been handled by the
      source handler. This won't be needed once Plugin.registerBatchHandler or Plugin.registerCompiler is
      released (I think).~~
  - [x] ~~Turns out we don't know which isopacks have to be compiled even on
        first run, so for the next step to work, we need to remove the local isopacks
        that are dependents of rocket:module from the app's .meteor/local/isopacks/.~~
  - [x] ~~Also delete the builds of the app's module.js files. We don't have
        to since apparently the build plugin handles the app files every time
        regardless.~~
  - [x] ~~If the plugin provider is running during Meteor's first run, then get
        the local dependents of rocket:module, and based on that determine how many
        times the source handler will execute (once for each module.js in the app, and
        once for each module.js in each local package).~~
    - [x] ~~Add a list of files added with api.addFiles to PackageInfo of a given package.~~

- [ ] ~~If the plugin provider is running due to a file change, use the first execution of
      the source handler to detect what package (including the app itself) is being
      recompiled, then based on that find out how many source handler executions
      are left.~~

- [ ] ~~Create the new batch handler method for the CompileManager class. (When
      this plugin provider script is running on the app side, we won't use a source
      handler any more for any compiling, instead the handler will do it's simple
      task of marking app-side handled files as in need of compiling with a comment.
      We'll have to take out the webpack functionality from the current source
      handler and use it in a new function, the batchHandler, that runs after all
      app-side files have been handled. The batch handler will compile all modules.js
      files in all package (local or not) of the application. In the future this
      batchHandler will be replaced by Meteor's Plugin.registerBatchHandler or
      Plugin.registerCompiler, whenever that gets introduced.)~~
  - [x] ~~In the batch handler, choose a temporary location to handle the output
        of all the entry points all at once (on a per-batch basis instead of on a
        per-file basis). Put the temporary location into .meteor of the current
        application to be compatible with Windows since Windows doesn't have a /tmp.~~
  - [x] ~~Get all the sources of module.js files of all the packages of the
        current app that depend on rocket:module. Get the sources from the isopacks
        (local or not).~~
  - [x] ~~Write these sources to the temporary location in some structure that
        organizes the files by package.~~
    - [x] ~~Remove the "not-compiled" placeholder from the files before writing them.~~
    - [ ] ~~Get the original sources from the Package Server API and add all the
          files that weren't added with `api.addFiles`, because those files might
          be `require`ed/`import`ed by entry point files, and those files aren't packaged
          when publishing to Atmosphere, otherwise entry points will fail to find the
          files. An alternative to the Package Server API (which relies on networking)
          might be to package all the local files of a package into the publish build.~~
  - [x] ~~List all the files from the previous step in the webpack config's entry
        option as an object of file names. The keys are the filename including the
        package name. For example: 'username_packagename/path/to/file.js'.~~
  - [x] ~~Get the npm dependencies of each pacakge (add this to the result of
        getPackageInfo)~~
  - [x] ~~For each package, write the npm dependencies (of the previous step,
        during app build), retrieved from a package's isopack, to package.json in
        the respective temporary location for the given package. Also put the isopack
        name in the name field and 0.0.0 in the versions field of the package.json.~~
  - [x] ~~Write a package.json file in the parent folder of the packages folder
        containing all the packages (of the temporary location). In it list each
        package as a dependency using the 'file:...' notation, using the isopack name
        of each package for the package names.~~
  - [x] ~~Run `npm install` in the parent folder of the packages folder.~~
  - [x] ~~List all the node_modules folders of each package that was installed
        into node_modules of the batchDir as places to look for dependencies in
        webpack config's resolve.fallback option.~~
  - [x] ~~Specify output.filename as '[name]' and output.path as './built',
        add the CommonsChunkPlugin and specify the common chunk name as
        'shared-modules.js', change dir to the parent-of-packages-folder, then run webpack!
        We've successfully code-splitted shared dependencies of all packages! woooo!~~
    - [x] ~~Figure out what to do with the fact that Webpack by default compiles
          for the web target, and relies on the `window` object which isn't
          available on the server-side.~~
      - [x] ~~For the 'os' platform, replace 'window' with 'RocketModule'.~~
      - [x] ~~Make RocketModule an empty object in rocket:module's
            shared-modules.js file and export it in package.js.~~
      - [x] ~~In the publish compile step, extend the 'this' of the entrypoint
            closures with RocketModule (exclude shared-modules.js)~~
  - [x] ~~Write the shared-modules.js file to the corresponding place in
        rocket:module's isopack.~~
  - [x] ~~Now loop through all the output files and write each one back to their
        original locations in the isopacks. We need to make sure to handle each one
        on a per architecture basis, and we also need to update each arch json file to
        contain the result file's byte lengths. At this point, the modified isopacks
        should run in the application!~~
    - [x] ~~Add a dummy file to rocket:module that gets handled by it's own (second)
          source handler, and since all packages are depending on rocket:module, we
          can write the shared-modules.js file to that location of rocket:module's
          isopack and therefore it will load before all the other entry points.~~

### v0.2.0
- [x] Register a new compiler with Plugin.registerCompiler.
- [ ] Redo everything but with the files handed to rocket:module by Meteor,
      thus eliminating the two previous month's worth of work. (:

### v1.0.0
- [ ] Finish commented TODOs that are left in rocket:module.
- [ ] Update README with usage and configuration documentation.
  - [ ] Describe how to use npm dependencies in an app directly, using a spare
        local package (basically like what meteorhacks:npm does).
- [ ] Celebrate! Wooooo!

### v1.x.x (in order of importance)
- [ ] Handle web.cordova builds on the app-side.
- [ ] Output errors encountered by Webpack when compiling entry points.
- [ ] Detect and deal with certain conditions.
  - [ ] When recompiling a local package during an app-rebuild (meteor is already
        running, not its first run), detect if the package's dependencies have
        changed. If so, other packages that share the same dependencies need to be
        recompiled too, so that shared libraries through code splitting works.
  - [ ] What happens if an app doesn't depend on rocket:module and has only
        non-local packages depending on rocket:module? Will rocket:module's build
        plugin run during app build? If not, how will we get it to run?
- [ ] Support npm dependencies for apps that already use meteorhacks:npm.
 - [ ] Simply detect meteorhacks:npm alongside dependents of rocket:module and
       install those dependencies.
- [ ] Test in Windows.
- [ ] Also make new source .map files for each isopack's output file.
- [ ] Code split for each architecture instead of all at once (each
      architecture may possibly have different shared modules).
